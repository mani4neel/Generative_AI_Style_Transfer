Overview of the key components and steps involved in the project:

1. Importing Libraries and Setup
Libraries like PyTorch, PIL, matplotlib, and NumPy are imported.
Environment setup includes checking for GPU availability and loading pre-trained models like VGG19.
2. Image Loading and Transformation
Functions are defined to load images, handle their sizes, and convert them into appropriate formats for neural style transfer.
Images are loaded, transformed, and moved to the GPU if available.
3. Feature Extraction and Gram Matrix Calculation
Functions are created to extract features from specific layers of the VGG model and compute the Gram matrix.
Content and style features are obtained once for the content and style images.
Style features' Gram matrices are calculated for selected layers.
4. Loss Calculation and Optimization
Content loss is computed as the difference between the content representations of the target and original content image.
Style loss is calculated by comparing Gram matrices of target and style images at different layers.
Total loss is a weighted sum of content and style losses.
The target image is iteratively optimized using an Adam optimizer to minimize the total loss.
5. Display and Visualization
Intermediate images are displayed at regular intervals during optimization.
At the end of optimization, the content image and the final stylized image are displayed side by side for comparison.
6. Hyperparameters and Weight Adjustments
Style weights for different layers, content weight, and style weight are defined to control the emphasis on style and content in the final image.
These weights can be adjusted to achieve desired artistic effects.
7. Final Outcome
The project generates a new image that preserves the content of one image while adopting the style of another image, creating a stylized output.
